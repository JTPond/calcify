# Calcify

 A crate for 3-D and 4-D vector and matrix algebra, conceived for use in physics simulations. Builds out from a basic ThreeVec struct including most commonly used operations built in.

## Note

All physics constants are exported in the top in SI units. To retrieve them in Planck or natural units call
 calcify::Consts::planck()
 or
 calcify::Consts::natural()
